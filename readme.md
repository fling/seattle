# @fling's Guide to Seattle

I wrote this guide for friends visiting Seattle. 

## Getting Around

Our public transport system isn’t great and doesn’t get you all the way to where you want to go at times (blame all the bodies of water). But we have Car2Go’s everywhere which is a great way to get around. You can find and unlock them from your phone and you can park for free anywhere in Seattle. I might recommend signing up for an account if you don’t already have one.

We also have a new public bike system, like London, New York, etc. The problem is we also have a lot of hills. So plan accordingly. Most of the areas I’ve noted below are flat once you get there.

There are a couple of areas that I would focus on to get the most out of your time here:

## Pioneer Square

This is old Seattle. It is actually a historic district, but it can be a ghost town at times. It can have a bar scene one night, filled sports fans on game days, but is also Seattle’s new foodie haven.

* The Underground Tour
* The Klondike Museum
* The Pergola, Totem Pole & The Original "Skid Row” on Yesler
* Salumi’s (Mario Batali’s parents place)
* Waterfall Garden (the site where UPS started)
* Carmine’s Il Terrazzo (fine itallian food. A hidden away gem)
* Bar Sajor (new foodie place. They do pizza’s on Tuesdays that aren’t on the menu)
* The Smith Tower (this was the Smith Corona building and tallest building west of the Miss for a long time)
* Sounders games (Soccer) are huge here. If there is a game when you are in town, I highly recommend trying to go if you can get tickets. Soccer is easily the popular sport of the Northwest.

I recommend before exploring Pioneer Square, that you go to MOHAI on South Lake Union. It is a newer museum about Seattle that is pretty awesome. You will learn a lot about Pioneer Square there.

# The Pike Place Market

This is a must for anyone visiting Seattle. It is packed with tourists, but it is the best place in Seattle to purchase fresh fish, produce etc. I shop there at least once a month. This market is a hub for some of the best seafood in the world. And a great place to get smoked salmon to take home if that is your thing.

Take time to explore. There are two markets and a ton of small shops on the lower levels. There are plenty of sit down restaurants, nearly all of them are good. Of you can get some great street food and take it with you.

The Market is located on a “woonerf” or living street, meaning that cars share the road with pedestrians. Many tourists stick to the sidewalks, which can be crowded and move very very slowly. My advice is don’t be afraid to walk in the street, or zig zag back and forth across the street in order to get around. It allows you to see a lot more and avoid the crowds. 

People like going to the first Starbucks. Expect a long line to get in. A lot of folks wait in the crowd to see the flying fish (https://www.pikeplacefish.com) but honestly any fish vendor will toss a fish to you if you buy one. They will pack it up and ship it to you.

You can take the “Hillclimb” down and head to the waterfront as well. There are tons of great photo opportunities, independent shops and curiosities along the way.

If you want to make a day of it, the Aquarium is at the bottom of the hillclimb and there are a few fun things on the waterfront (like the new Ferris Wheel). But there is a bunch of construction going on down there.

At night, the “Market" is pretty quiet. There is the Can-Can Cabert which is super fun if you are feeling saucy. The Showbox and Triple Door are great venues for live music.

The market is 10-15m walk from Pioneer Square (uphill).

# Downtown

There are a ton of great places downtown. It is a bit of a walk from Pioneer Square, but you can hop in the Bus Tunnel and ride the Light Rail from the Smith Tower to any stop in the heart of downtown. I think it may be free. I never pay if I’m just going a few stops. If you get stopped just tell you were confused.

There is actually a lot of hidden away gems Downtown, but they tend to be pretty spaced out. For longer stays I recommend people explore, but for short stays I like to take people to the Public Library. This is a Rem Koolhouse designed masterpiece of architecture. It is free and you should take time to just walk the “book spiral.” If you like books, architecture or design, this is a must see.

# Seattle Center

Seattle Center is the complex that includes the Space Needle, Pacific Science Center, EMP etc. It is the old World’s Fair complex and a lot of it is pretty old and dingy. But it holds a special place in every Seattleite’s heart as they almost always have a fond memory from here.

Tourists love the Space Needle. It is fun to do on a clear day, but I only go when people are visiting. There is a rotating restaurant with notoriously overpriced food. It is fun to do, but if you go, do brunch and not dinner.

There is a new Chihuly Glass Museum which I haven’t been to, but is supposed to be nice.

I would skip the Pacific Science Center. It doesn’t even come close to other cities science museums.

My favorite thing to do is EMP museum. It is mostly Paul Allen’s private collection of Jimi Hendricks and Sci-Fi stuff, but the exhibits are world class. And the Geary designed building is a one of a kind. The food at the Turntable Cafe is actually pretty good.

# South Lake Union

This is Seattle’s newest “neighborhood” and by neighborhood I mean Paul Allen’s real estate experiment that is 80% Amazon. Seattleites mostly complain about it, but there are some finds here.

Fourth of July Weekend, this entire area will be packed to watch the fireworks over South Lake Union. If you can get down there is pretty amazing thing to see. The lake will be *filled* with boats.

- South Lake Union Park is one of the best in the city.
- MOHAI is fantastic
- Boats are a big part of Seattle. And I recommend going to the The Wooden Boat Center. Its free and you get to go on board a lot of different types of boats. On Sundays they do a free sail around Lake Union. You need to get there early to sign up on nice days.
- I would highly recommend taking a float plane tour over Seattle. It is about $100 per person and pretty amazing way to see the area. 
- Or if you aren’t on a budget, take a float plane up to the San Juan islands and stay overnight and fly back the next day. They have a ton of packages at Kenmore Air.
- Also on the pricey side, but *super* fun is you can rent a Duffy Boat and just tool around Lake Union: http://theelectricboatco.com – this is one of my favorite summer time activities. I recommend the evening. It is also the best way to see all of the house boats

Also, if you are into movies, Paul Allen spared no expense renovating the Cinerama theater which is a short walk from South Lake Union. They serve good beer and food and it is one of the most advanced cinema’s in the world. They have reserved seating, so you can book in advance if you want to see a blockbuster.

# Capitol Hill

Capitol Hill, is the cultural heart of Seattle. It is where the LGBT and creative crowd is mostly based. This is also where the best restaurants in Seattle are. You can use OpenTable or Urban Spoon to find recommendations and reservations. You can pack in a lot of great sights, sounds, food and indie shopping.  

However Capitol Hill is going through a bit of a transition right now. It can appear a bit grungy and off putting to out of towners, but it is worth a visit. Most Friday & Stautrday nights on Pike & Pine turn into a Bro & Woo Girl scene, so I would explore other areas of Capitol Hill on those nights, like 12th or15th which is more mellow.

* Just explore Pike & Pine East of I-5. Ton’s of cool shops and food
* Starbucks’ new Willy Wonka of Coffee https://news.starbucks.com/news/starbucks-reserve-roastery-and-tasting-room
* Broadway (runs North-South) has a lot more.
* Dick’s on Broadway is Seattle’s In-n-Out and worth a stop.
-*Volunteer Park

# Ballard & Fremont

Ballard is our cool Swedish neighborhood with a long tradition of fishing. It is about a 10-15 drive to get there. But once you are there it is pretty sweet. I recommend going on Saturday when the Farmers Market is in full swing. Check the schedule before you venture out there though.

Fremont is near Ballard and was once our Hippie neighborhood, but is now where Adobe & Google are based. 

* Bike the Ship Canal. The Ship Canal connects Puget Sound, Lake Union and Lake Washington. The Burke Gilman Trail runs all along it and it a popular bike path. You can rent bikes all over Seattle and it is worth a ride.
* Ballard Locks is pretty awesome. Especially over this weekend it will be packed with boats coming in from Puget Sound.
* There is a Red Mill across the street from the Locks. A Red Mill burger is a very splendid thing and something you must have before you die.
* The Ballard Farmers Market is amazing on the weekends only
* Theo Chocolate Tours in Fremont is fun. Or you can just stop by the tasting room and sample a ton of free chocolate.
* The Fremont Troll Sculpture
* The Interurbans Sculpture
* The Fremont Bridge (one of the most opened in the world)
* Gasworks Park (but avoid on the 4th!)
* Golden Garden’s if you want to spend some time on the Beach
* Ivar’s Salmon House has an all-you-can-eat buffet brunch on Sundays that is pretty awesome. It has a great view of Seattle and you will probably see Dale Chihuly there who’s studio is right next door and is pretty much there every Sunday.

# Bainbridge Island

Water is a big part of Seattle and we have a very big ferry system that takes you to the islands in the Puget Sound. When I lived in Pioneer Square one of my favorite things to do on a summer night is walk on the Bainbridge Ferry and ride it over and then ride it back. It is about 45mins each way and is pretty cheap. Just sit on the deck and see Seattle the way it should be seen – from the water!

You can also get off the ferry and walk to the shops and restaurants on Bainbridge. It is super quaint and a bit sleepy. A stark contrast from Seattle. And lot of folks live on Bainbridge and commute over every day.

# Out of Seattle

If you have a car, I would recommend trying to get out of the city. I like to take people over the floating bridges. There aren’t that many of them in the world and we have two with the city. 520 will take you over to Bellevue and Redmond/Microsoft. You can see Bill Gates’ compound from this one. As you leave Seattle you will see UW, the Arboretum and a bunch of people Kayaking. As you drive over the bridge you will likely see Mount Rainer to the South, the highest peak in the continental US.

I-90 is further south. It isn’t as scenic as you go over Mercer Island – home of the billionaires – right in the middle.

Bellevue itself is a very wealthy surburbia. People that live in Seattle usually dislike “Eastsiders” and I’m sure vice versa.

But you can go in a loop over 520, through Bellevue and back over I-90 which will dump you right in Pioneer Square.

* Museum of Flight – If you are into planes and things, the Museum of Flight done by Boeing Field is pretty cool. You can go on a retired Airforce One, Concorde, 747, etc. They also have the only Space Shuttle Simulator in the world that you can go in.
* Heritage Flight Museum – To the North, near Everett and Boeing’s Factories, Paul Allen has his own collection of planes. It is much smaller than Museum of Flight, but these planes actually fly every weekend. They also have one of the only Zero fighters left intact. Typically if you buy a pass to EMP you can get into this museum for free.
* Victoria Clipper – a fast boat that takes you to Victoria BC. It takes about an hour and it pretty fun. I think it is $100-ish per person.
* Lots of Hikes – You can drive for 45m to 1hr and get to woods and do some amazing hikes. If Outdoorsy is your thing, we have a lot of it.
